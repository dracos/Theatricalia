<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>Theatricalia will hopefully become <em>the</em> repository of theatre
productions on the internet. In doing so, it will enable people to discover
theatre that is going on around them, follow actors they have seen in previous
productions, and record memorable events of productions they have seen.
</p>

<p>Theatricalia was written by me in my spare time, because I needed it to exist.
It launches with the data for all <acronym title="Royal Shakespeare Company">RSC</acronym> productions since its foundation in 1879,
all Birmingham Repertory Theatre productions up to and including 1971 when it moved to its current location in Centenary Square, and the wide variety of productions held by the University of Bristol Theatre Archive.</p>
