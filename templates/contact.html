<h1>Criticism</h1>

2. The art of estimating the qualities and character of literary or artistic work;
   the function or work of a critic.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This site is run as a hobby;
constructive positive criticism or other contact is welcome &ndash; especially
if you&rsquo;re from a theatre with a large archive you want to include
on the site! :-)

<p>You can see or make
<a href="https://github.com/dracos/Theatricalia/issues">feature
requests and bug reports at GitHub</a>, email me at
<code>principal</code> at this domain
(though be aware I do get quite a lot of email, so don&rsquo;t be alarmed if I
take some time to reply), see if anyone is on 
<acronym title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</acronym> in #theatricalia on Freenode,
or I am on Twitter as
<a href="https://twitter.com/theatricalia">@theatricalia</a>
(or <a href="https://twitter.com/dracos">@dracos</a> for my personal account
which is much more inane).
