<h1>Criticism</h1>

   the function or work of a critic.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a critic these days. This site is run as a hobby by me and me alone;
I do not have the time or inclination for negative
criticism, and it will be summarily ignored &ndash; I like this website, and
you are under no obligation to use it. &#9786; Constructive positive criticism is of
course welcome, though be aware I do get quite a lot of email, so don&rsquo;t
be alarmed if I take some time to reply. You can email me at <a
