<h1>Criticism</h1>

<blockquote class="verse"><pre>
1. The action of criticizing, or passing judgement upon the qualities or merits of anything
2. The art of estimating the qualities and character of literary or artistic work;
   the function or work of a critic.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This site is run as a hobby;
constructive positive criticism or other contact is welcome &ndash; especially
if you&rsquo;re from a theatre with a large archive you want to include
on the site! :-)

<p>Please note that all the information I have is on the site – I don’t have
any further information on a particular production or person that I could give
you. If you have an observation about a production, or a photograph concerning
something on the site, please do add it to the site directly, thank you.</p>
